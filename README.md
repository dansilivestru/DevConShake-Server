Awesome.

## Server

Located under `server/`. Uses `node.js`, `express` and `socket.io`. Make
sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. Then `cd` into the `server/`
folder and run `npm install` to get the dependencies sorted out. To get
the server running:

    $ cd server
    $ node app.js

That should start a local server on port 3000.
